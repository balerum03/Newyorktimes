                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics

                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
                could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </div>

                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing,
                but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

            Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions.
            The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

            <q>The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,</q> Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994.
            <q>I’ve been hooked ever since,</q> he said.

            <p class="fagcap-para">The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth.</p>

        <div class="art-parag">
            In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
        </div>

        <div class="art-parag">
            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
            said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
        </div>

        <div class="art-parag">
            Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

        <div class="art-parag">
            <q>We had no expectations what we would see,</q> Dr. Kovac said.
        </div>

        <div class="art-parag">
            The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
        </div>

        <div class="art-parag">
            <h2 class="sp-time">A Special Time</h2>

            The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
        </div>

        <div class="art-parag">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
            in its earliest, hottest moments.
        </div>


        <div class="art-parag">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
        </div>

        <div class="art-parag">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</div>

        <div class="art-parag">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</div>


        <div class="art-parag">Similarly, the universe could "supercool" and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
        </div>


        <div class="art-parag">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
        </div>


        <div class="art-parag">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        </div>



        <div class="art-parag">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across.
            <q>It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free
                lunch,</q> Dr.Guth likes to say, <q> but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.</q>
        </div>



        <div class="art-parag">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos
            will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</div>


        <div class="art-parag">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.</div>


        <div class="art-parag">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
        </div>


        <div class="art-parag"><q>If you trace your cosmic roots,</q> said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, <q>you wind up
                at inflation.</q>
