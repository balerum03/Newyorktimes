    <p class="art-parag">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, 
    an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
    with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, 
    stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
    venturing far beyond the world of known physics
    </p>
    <p class="art-parag">
    He was trying to understand why there was no trace
    of some exotic particles that should have been created
    in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
    made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch 
    in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused 
    space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
    causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a 
    prodigiously violent instant.
    </p>
    <p class="art-parag">
    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why 
    the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
    warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
     and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
    diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.   
    </p>
    <p class="art-parag">
    “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page 
    and drew a double box around it.
    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported 
    that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, 
    known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
    </p>
    <p class="art-parag">
    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#" class="p-tag">the first sliver of cosmic 
    time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by 
    John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected 
    ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#" class="p-tag"> gravitational waves</a> — the 
    signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly
     a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. 
     They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac 
     and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.   
    </p>

    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, 
    though many, including
    Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
    </p>
    <p class="art-parag" >
    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark 
    in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
    pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
    It would open vast realms of time and space and energy 
    to science and speculation.
    </p>
    <P class="art-parag">
    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, 
    extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds 
    of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch 
    in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. 
    Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number 
    of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, 
    like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
    </P>
   <p class="art-parag">
    <h1>‘As Big as It Gets’</h1>
    <br>
    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
    operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle 
    accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. 
    Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
    gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
    general relativity, should ruffle space-time.   
   </p>

   <p class="art-parag">
    Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, 
    an early-universe expert who was not part of 
    the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
   </p>
   <p class="art-parag">
    He continued, “This is a signal from the very
    earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded 
    in gravitational waves.”
   </p>
   <p class="art-parag">
    The ripples manifested themselves as faint 
    spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
    that permeates space and preserves a picture of 
    the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as
     hot as the surface of the sun.   
   </p>
   <p class="art-parag">
    Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an
    experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging 
    of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their 
    results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
    Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers
    submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
